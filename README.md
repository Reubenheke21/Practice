# Python Rental Share Calculator

My initial idea came from an issue I had when flatsharing which was trying to work out how much everyone should pay seeing as people had different pay frequencies etc.

It was a problem I had and I want to help the flat sharing process even more now with our housing crisis and cost of living go up.

This is very similar to a budget app however it takes into account all your hosuehold bills, your rent/mortgage, utilities, council rates etc. Add them all together and then pop out an amount that is tailored to each individual person who uses this app.

My first idea was to get the basic information down pat, I know I wanted to get it to ask for the frequency first of the users pay and then went from there designing weekly first as most rental payments are usually weekly. I managed to get the basic stuff done and I can see where I want to go however I have my first challenge of the task and that is how to save each individual amount and where to store it/spit it out.

I am currently playing with lists but starting to lean more to dicts. I will continue to update when I have more information.
